    <h2>General Info</h2>
        <ul>The PUMA is a futuristic and unusual vehicle. It has a large profile, strong armour for an IFV, and weighs more than a T-72A, but the mobility is still very good because of its impressive engine with more than 1,000 horsepower. The unmanned turret is equipped with a 30 mm autocannon with access to APFSDS and airburst rounds, reminiscent of the Swedish CV90 family. The cherry on top is the MUSS soft-kill active protection system, which interferes with the guidance of incoming ATGMs. Although the PUMA is difficult to hide and is not particularly threatening to most MBTs from the front, it is a fairly tough target to destroy and can be a nightmare for enemy IFVs and helicopters, as it can shrug off most of their weapons and retaliate in turn.</ul>
    <h3>Survivability and armour</h3>
    <h4>ERA</h4>
        <ul>Effective action against the cumulative ammunition</ul>
    <h4>Composite armour</h4>
        <ul>Balanced protection against all types of ammunition</ul>
    <h4>Smoke grenades</h4>
        <ul>Creation of a smoke screen in front of the vehicle</ul>

        <ul>Notifies about the vehicle's exposure to laser emissions</ul>
    <h4>Armour front / side / back</h4>
    <h4>Hull 32 / 15 / 11</h4>
    <h4>Turret 25 / 15 / 15</h4>
    <h4>Crew of 3 people</h4>

    <h3>Mobility</h3>
    <h4>Speed forward/back</h4>
        <ul>71/31 km/h</ul>
    <h4>Number of gears</h4>
        <ul>10 forward, 5 backward</ul>

    <h3>Armaments</h3>
    <h4>Laser rangefinder</h4>
        <ul>Reduces the error and increases the maximum measurable distance of the rangefinder</ul>
    <h4>Night vision device</h4>
        <ul>Improves visibility by enhancing natural light or active illumination</ul>
    <h4>Thermal imager</h4>
        <ul>Allows to see thermal radiation in the infrared range day and night</ul>
    
    <h3>Main armament</h3>
    <h3>30 mm MK 30-2/ABM cannon</h3>
    <h4>Two-plane stabilizer</h4>

        <ul>-10°/45°</ul>

    <h3>Usage in battles</h3>
        <ul>The PUMA IFV is an effective vehicle against all types of targets, and even the heaviest of tanks such as the T-10M can even be defeated with a flanking manoeuvre with APFSDS to the direct side at point blank. The best way to play the PUMA IFV is to go on the flank, using its mobility to get to places quickly. It has access to generation 3 thermals for the gunner and commander, and a very good optic which makes sniping an easy job to do. With the crewless turret, you can easily sit hull down in most positions which makes it hard for your enemies to effectively target you, though you are a big target, so it's best to be aware on the move.

            Another way to play is being a support vehicle and slightly being aggressive, where you can support your teammates at the frontline aiming for weak spots of enemies with APFSDS, or flanking them as the APFSDS can cut through easy weak spots and the sides and rear of enemies. While the PUMA can survive and soak up shots due to the empty space inside the vehicle, you can still be disabled by an engine shot, or a well placed shot to the side where all your crew is packed together. The PUMA provides good protection against most chemical warhead weapons aside from tandem charged warheads, as the PUMA is equipped with a mix of CLARA Explosive Reactive Armour, and composite armour. It may occasionally bounce early APDS and APFSDS to the angle of the frontal armour but it's best to still play cautiously as no vehicle is invincible.</ul>

    <h3>Pros and Cons</h3>
    <h4>Pros:</h4>
        <ul>Access to IRCM that can disrupt most common missiles</ul>
        <ul>ERA on the side of the tank that will stop any chemical warheads</ul>
        <ul>Crewless turret that can enable you to hull down effectively</ul>
        <ul>The turret is sealed away from the interior of the hull and won't detonate most of APHE shells, significantly reducing potential of collateral damage</ul>
        <ul>Unlike with the similar IFVs, it is incredibly difficult to destroy it without actually taking out the crew</ul>
        <ul>Access to APFSDS for an autocannon</ul>
        <ul>Good mobility for its size</ul>
        <ul>Optics can shift from a general melee X2 zoom to the near-maximum sniper X15</ul>
        <ul>Generation 3 Thermals for Commander and Gunner</ul>
        <ul>Laser Warning System to alert you of incoming fire from tanks or helicopters</ul>
        <ul>Has access to Auto tracking which greatly increases it's anti-air capability</ul>
    <h4>Cons:</h4>
        <ul>Big target for its vehicle type</ul>
        <ul>Fire rate is subpar compared to most of its counterparts</ul>
        <ul>Has a timed-fuse Shrapnel shell instead of HE-VT, which is inconvenient when fighting aircraft</ul>
        <ul>IRCM can be spotted easily in NVD and Thermal sights</ul>
        <ul>No access to ATGMs unlike its counterparts</ul>
        <ul>Engine area is in the front, can be disabled easily</ul>
        <ul>Very insufficent armor against kinetic shells</ul>
